They're actually shrimp now!

Can't have pet shrimp? Same! So why not make some virtual shrimp? These require zero attention and are very hardy pets! 
Sure I could have set up a tank and learned how to take care of shrimp in the time it's going to take for me to finish this, but at least I'll have the experience gained from this fun challenge!

So far, the shrimp zoom around the screen but don't really do much else. Coming soon (hopefully), will be a tank background instead of the static linear gradient currently featured, and some more shrimp interactions!
